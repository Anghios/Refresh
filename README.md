# Refresh
Refresh by Surce v1.2.4c is a Python script that streamlines Docker container management by updating container images in specified directories. The script scans folders for 'docker-compose.yaml' files, pulls the latest image if outdated, and restarts the container with updated images. It also allows an option to delete old images after updates.
